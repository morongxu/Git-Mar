      But that's not all; at night, join us in the backroom as our resident 
      DJ spins a choice selection of trance and drumamp;bass beats across 
      our spacious tiki-themed dance floor. Or just hang out in one of our 
      comfy white vinyl booths at the dance bar. You can have your elixirs 
      delivered from the main lounge right to the dance floor. If you've 
      had enough of the beat, just head back to the lounge area to relax.
      And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll always be 
      connected with our wireless Internet access.
